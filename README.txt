The 3 compartment model used in my dissertation research converted from Matlab to Julia. This won't have tyhe full functionality of my dissertation code but should provide the necessary ideas to undertand the project and analysis.

Look at the Overview Jupyter Notebook for info about the code and the project.

## Code Organization
- Tutorial
	- Holds files for the storage of code written following tutorials and Julia teaching material.
	- Sources:
		- Julia Programming Language Youtube
- Intro To Computational Thinking
	- Following along to MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 on Julia YouTube 
- GRACE
	- Folder for raw images and Inkscape images for publication and presentation
- ParameterAnalysis
	- Exploratory parameter analysis of the parameter sets found by TD search
